We primarily \n\nwork with (1)________ and have to understand their features. The (2)________ \n\nof elements and alloys are explained in terms of physical, chemical, electrical, and \n\nmechanical properties. (3) ________properties relate to colour, density, weight, \n\nand heat conductivity. (4)________ properties involve the behaviour of the metal \n\nwhen placed in contact with the atmosphere, salt water, or other substances. (5) \n\n_______properties  encompass \n\nthe  electrical  conductivity,  resistance,  and \n\nmagnetic  qualities  of  the  metal.  The  (6)  __________properties  relate  to  load-carrying  ability,  wear  resistance, \n\nhardness, and elasticity. When selecting stock for a job, your main concern is the mechanical properties of the metal. \n\nThe  various  properties  of  (7)  ________and  alloys  were  determined  in  the  laboratories  of  manufacturers  and  by \n\nvarious societies interested in (8) _________development. Charts presenting the properties of a particular metal or \n\nalloy  are  available  in  many  commercially  published  reference  books.  The  charts  provide  information  on  the \n\n(9)_________,  tensile  strength,  electrical  conductivity,  (10)  ___________properties,  and  other  properties  of  a \n\nparticular metal or alloy. Simple tests can be conducted to determine some of the properties of a metal; however, we \n\nnormally  use  a  metal  test  only  as  an  aid  for  identifying  apiece  of  stock.  Some  of  these  methods  of  testing  are \n\ndiscussed later in this chapter. Properties like strength, hardness, toughness, elasticity, plasticity, brittleness, and \n\nductility and malleability are all mechanical properties used as (11) ___________of how metals behave under a load. \n\nThese properties are described in terms of the types of force or stress that the metal must withstand and how these \n\nare  (12)_________.Common  types  of  (13)________  are  compression,  tension,  shear,  torsion,  impact,  or  a \n\ncombination of these stresses, such as fatigue. Compression stresses develop within a material when forces compress \n\nor crush the material. A column that supports an overhead beam is in compression, and the internal stresses that \ndevelop within the column are (14)_________. Tension (or tensile) stresses develop when a material is subject to a \n\n(15) _______ load; for example, when using a wire rope to lift a load or when using it as a guy to anchor an antenna. \n\n“Tensile strength” is  defined as resistance to  (16) __________stress  or pull and can be measured in  pounds per \n\nsquare inch of cross section. (17) _________stresses occur within a material when external forces are applied along \n\nparallel lines in opposite directions. Shearing forces can separate material by sliding part of it in one direction and \n\nthe  rest  in  the  opposite  direction.  Some  materials  are  equally  strong  in  compression,  (18)_______,  and  shear. \nHowever, if the same force is applied in a steady motion (not bent back and forth), the rod cannot be broken. The \n\ntendency of a material to fail after repeated (19) ______at the same point is known as (20) _________. \n\nNB: Only Answers Reported in the Appropriate Tables will be Considered \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fName:……………………………………………………………… \n\nGroup: …………………………… \n\nN° \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\na.
