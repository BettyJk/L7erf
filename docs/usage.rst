Usage
=====

After launching **L7erf Bot**, you will be presented with a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit. The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with three primary options available for users. These features are tailored to help students access academic resources, get quick summaries of documents, and explore general information about ENSAM Meknès.

---

1. **Summarization**
   ---------------
   The **Summarization** feature enables users to input text or upload PDF documents for the bot to process and generate concise summaries. It supports both English and French languages, making it a versatile tool for multilingual document processing. This feature can handle diverse document structures, including tables and scanned content, thanks to integrated Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

   **How to Use**:
   - Click on the **Summarization** tab at the top of the application.
   - You can either upload a PDF or paste text directly into the input field.
   - If you upload a PDF, you will be asked to select the language of the document (English or French).
   - Press the **Summarize** button to initiate the summarization process.
   - The summarized content will appear on the screen, allowing you to quickly review the key points.

   **Supported Features**:
   - **Multilingual Support**: Both English and French text can be processed for summarization.
   - **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: When uploading a scanned document, OCR will extract the text from images within the PDF, ensuring that even scanned documents can be summarized.
   - **Table Extraction**: The bot is capable of recognizing and summarizing tables found in PDF documents, making it ideal for structured content.

   **Advanced Tips**:
   - **Refining Output**: If the summarization results are too brief or too detailed, you can try adjusting the document input for clarity. Complex layouts may require additional manual adjustments.
   - **File Size Limitations**: Ensure that your PDF is not too large for the bot to process effectively. Large documents may take longer to summarize or could cause timeouts on limited systems.

   **Example Queries**:
   - "What is the admission process for the Civil Engineering program?"

Navigation Tips
---------------
- You can easily switch between the tabs by clicking on the desired option at the top of the interface.
- The input field is versatile, capable of handling both text-based queries (for general information or course details) and document uploads (for summarization).
- The app is designed to be fully responsive, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Whether you’re on the go or at your desk, the application adapts to your screen size and usage context.

---

Additional Features
-------------------
- **Real-time Feedback**: As you interact with the chatbot, responses are generated in real-time, ensuring an immediate answer to your queries without long waiting times.
- **Contextual Responses**: The bot doesn’t just answer randomly—it processes your query in context, so it understands academic and general questions appropriately and provides accurate, targeted information.

   **Use Case Example**: If you ask about "student clubs" in the context of **General Info**, the bot will provide a list of all clubs related to student life at ENSAM, rather than general information about clubs.

Advanced Usage Scenarios
-------------------------
- **Multiple Document Summarization**: For users who need summaries for multiple documents, batch upload options can streamline this process. Simply upload several PDFs and the bot will generate summaries for each.
- **Interactive Queries**: For courses or general info, you can follow up with further questions, and the bot will adapt its responses based on the context of the conversation. For example, after asking about "admission processes," you can inquire about specific program details without starting a new query.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: For ENSAM students, the bot can also provide insights into curriculum changes, exam schedules, and new course offerings based on the most recent data.
