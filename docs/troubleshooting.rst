### Common Problems and Solutions

In this section, we address some of the most common issues encountered during the fine-tuning and deployment phases of the **L7erf Bot** project. For each problem, we provide the cause, solution, and additional notes on how to prevent or mitigate similar issues in the future.

#### **Problem 1: Overfitting During Fine-Tuning**
- **Cause**: Overfitting occurs when the model is trained too extensively on a small, specialized dataset (in this case, the ENSAM-specific data). With an insufficient amount of diverse data and too many epochs, the model tends to memorize the training data rather than generalizing to new, unseen inputs.
  
- **Solution**:
  1. **Increased Dataset Diversity**: To combat overfitting, we added a more general-purpose dataset in addition to the ENSAM-specific data. This diverse data allows the model to learn broader patterns and improves its generalization capabilities.
  2. **Reduced Epochs**: The fine-tuning process was shortened to 2 additional epochs after the ENSAM-specific dataset was introduced. Limiting the number of epochs prevents the model from overfitting to the small dataset and allows it to focus on the most essential patterns.
  3. **Cross-Validation**: Implemented k-fold cross-validation during fine-tuning to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the training data. This ensures that the model performs well on various data splits, rather than just memorizing one set.
  
  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Overfitting Detection**: Overfitting can often be detected by comparing training and validation losses. If the training loss decreases significantly while the validation loss remains constant or increases, overfitting is occurring.
  - **Early Stopping**: Using an early stopping mechanism can help halt training as soon as the validation loss starts to increase, thereby preventing overfitting.

#### **Problem 2: High Learning Rate Leading to Unstable Training**
- **Cause**: The initial learning rate used during fine-tuning (1e-4) was too high for the BLOOM-560M model. A high learning rate causes the model's optimizer to take overly large steps in the weight update process, leading to erratic training behavior, where the loss function fluctuates or does not converge.
  
- **Solution**:
  1. **Adjusted Learning Rate**: The learning rate was reduced to 5e-6, which is more suitable for fine-tuning large models like BLOOM-560M. A smaller learning rate ensures that the model's weights are updated more gradually and in a stable manner.
  2. **Optimizer Adjustment**: We switched to the **AdamW** optimizer, which is known for its ability to provide stable updates for large transformer models like BLOOM-560M. AdamW also has weight decay that helps regularize the model and prevents overfitting.
  3. **Learning Rate Scheduler**: We implemented a learning rate scheduler to gradually decrease the learning rate as the training progresses. This allows the model to start with a larger learning rate (to explore the parameter space) and then fine-tune with smaller steps as the model converges.
  
  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Gradient Clipping**: In some cases, gradient clipping may also be applied to prevent gradient explosions, especially when training large models with a high learning rate.
  - **Learning Rate Search**: To avoid choosing an ineffective learning rate, it's often helpful to perform a learning rate range test. This involves gradually increasing the learning rate during the initial training stages to identify the optimal value.

#### **Problem 3: Slow Inference Times on Local Machine**
- **Cause**: Slow inference times may occur when deploying **L7erf Bot** on hardware with limited computational power, such as a local machine without GPU acceleration. This is especially common when running large models like BLOOM-560M, which require significant resources for both inference and model loading.
  
- **Solution**:
  1. **Model Quantization**: We implemented **model quantization** to reduce the model size by converting the weights from 32-bit floating point to lower precision (e.g., 8-bit). This reduces both the memory footprint and the time required for model inference without significantly sacrificing accuracy.
  2. **Hardware Optimization**: Optimized the deployment environment to make better use of available hardware. This includes using multiple CPU cores for parallel processing or leveraging available GPUs for faster computations.
  3. **Model Caching**: For repeated queries, we implemented a **model caching mechanism** that stores previous results, so the bot can return responses instantly without recomputing the results for each request.
  
  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Batching Inference**: In scenarios where multiple users are interacting with the bot, **batching inference requests** can improve performance by processing multiple requests in parallel, reducing latency.
  - **Asynchronous Inference**: Consider using asynchronous calls to handle multiple user requests concurrently without blocking.

#### **Problem 4: OCR Extraction Inaccuracy**
- **Cause**: The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool used for extracting text from scanned PDFs or images occasionally produces inaccurate results. This may be due to poor quality of scanned documents, noise in images, or the presence of unusual fonts.
  
- **Solution**:
  1. **Image Preprocessing**: To improve OCR accuracy, we applied image preprocessing techniques such as **image denoising**, **thresholding**, and **deskewing** to make the scanned text clearer before OCR extraction.
  2. **Switching OCR Tools**: We replaced the default OCR library with **Tesseract 5.0** or **Google Vision API**, which offer improved recognition accuracy, especially on noisy or poorly scanned documents.
  3. **Manual Review**: We integrated a manual review system, allowing users to flag OCR errors for manual correction. This feature ensures that critical documents are processed with high precision.
  
  **Additional Notes**:
  - **OCR Error Detection**: Use OCR confidence scores to automatically detect low-quality results. If the confidence score is below a certain threshold, the document can be flagged for review or reprocessing.
  - **Training Custom OCR Models**: In cases where Tesseract or other OCR tools do not provide satisfactory results, you may consider training a custom OCR model tailored to your specific documents or font types.
