Troubleshooting
==================

In this section, we address common issues encountered during the fine-tuning, deployment, and usage phases of the **L7erf Bot** project. Each issue includes its cause, solution, and additional tips to prevent similar challenges.

---

#### Problem 1: Overfitting During Fine-Tuning
- **Cause**: The model is overly trained on a small, specialized dataset, leading to memorization rather than generalization.
  
- **Solution**:
  1. **Diversify Dataset**: Add general-purpose data alongside ENSAM-specific content to broaden learning patterns.
  2. **Reduce Epochs**: Limit fine-tuning to 2-3 additional epochs for small datasets.
  3. **Use Cross-Validation**: Employ k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance across data splits.

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Detection**: Compare training and validation losses. Overfitting is indicated when training loss decreases while validation loss increases.
  - **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping to halt training when validation performance degrades.

#### Problem 2: High Learning Rate Leading to Unstable Training
- **Cause**: A high learning rate causes erratic weight updates, preventing model convergence.

- **Solution**:
  1. **Reduce Learning Rate**: Use a smaller rate like 5e-6 for stable training with large models like BLOOM-560M.
  2. **Use AdamW Optimizer**: Switch to AdamW for more stable weight updates and integrated weight decay.
  3. **Apply Learning Rate Scheduler**: Gradually decrease the learning rate as training progresses.

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Gradient Clipping**: Prevent gradient explosions by clipping gradients.
  - **Learning Rate Range Test**: Test different rates to identify the optimal value.

#### Problem 3: Slow Inference Times on Local Machine
- **Cause**: Hardware limitations, such as lack of GPU acceleration, hinder model performance.

- **Solution**:
  1. **Quantize the Model**: Reduce the model size by converting weights to lower precision (e.g., 8-bit).
  2. **Leverage Hardware**: Optimize for multi-core CPUs or GPUs.
  3. **Implement Model Caching**: Cache previous responses to avoid redundant computations.

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Batch Inference**: Process multiple queries simultaneously for better efficiency.
  - **Asynchronous Requests**: Use asynchronous processing to handle user interactions without blocking.

#### Problem 4: OCR Extraction Inaccuracy
- **Cause**: Low-quality scans, noise, or unusual fonts affect OCR accuracy.

- **Solution**:
  1. **Preprocess Images**: Enhance clarity with denoising, thresholding, and deskewing techniques.
  2. **Switch to Better OCR Tools**: Use advanced tools like Tesseract 5.0 or Google Vision API.
  3. **Enable Manual Review**: Allow users to flag errors for manual correction.

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Confidence Scores**: Flag low-confidence OCR results for reprocessing.
  - **Custom OCR Models**: Train specialized OCR models for domain-specific documents.

#### Problem 5: Streamlit Not Starting
- **Cause**: Missing or improperly installed dependencies.

- **Solution**:
  1. **Verify Installation**: Check if Streamlit is installed:
     .. code-block:: bash

        pip show streamlit
     
     If missing, install it:
     .. code-block:: bash

        pip install streamlit
  2. **Reinstall Dependencies**: Reinstall all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
     .. code-block:: bash

        pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Python Version**: Ensure compatibility between Streamlit and your Python version.
  - **Virtual Environment**: Run the application in an isolated environment to avoid conflicts.

#### Problem 6: Issues with Environment Variables
- **Cause**: Misconfigured or missing `.env` file.

- **Solution**:
  1. **Check .env File**: Ensure the file is correctly configured and matches the template provided in `.env.example`.
  2. **Verify Variables**: Use a command-line tool to confirm that variables are being loaded:
     .. code-block:: bash

        printenv | grep YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **dotenv Library**: Confirm the dotenv library is properly installed and imported.
  - **Path Check**: Ensure `.env` is in the same directory as the application.

---

#### Problem 7: Model Fails to Load
- **Cause**: Large models like BLOOM-560M may not load due to insufficient memory.

- **Solution**:
  1. **Increase Memory**: Allocate more RAM or switch to a machine with higher memory.
  2. **Load in FP16**: Load the model in 16-bit precision (FP16) to reduce memory requirements:
     .. code-block:: python

        model = model.half()
  3. **Load on GPU**: If available, offload the model to GPU for faster loading and inference.

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Lazy Loading**: Load specific parts of the model on-demand rather than the entire model at once.
  - **Sharded Models**: Use sharded models to split the loading process across multiple devices.
